# Exercise 1: Review - Variables, Input & Operators
# -------------------------------------------
# In this exercise, you’ll work in groups of 2–3.
# You’ll review how to:
# - Store and use variables
# - Use input() and print()
# - Apply arithmetic and comparison operators
#
# Each learner will build on the previous one’s work.
# This means you’ll use and extend each other’s variables.
#
# -------------------------------------------
# GROUP INSTRUCTIONS
# -------------------------------------------
# Work in groups of 2–3 learners.
# You will all share the same GitHub Classroom repository.
#
# After each task:
# - The learner who is currently coding will git add, commit, and push.
# - The next learner will move to their own computer, git pull, and continue.
#
# If you are in pairs:
# - Swap computers after each task (back and forth).

# Task 1: Storing and Printing Variables
# -------------------------------------------
print("-------------------------------------------\n"
    + "Task 1: Storing and Printing Variables\n"
    + "-------------------------------------------")
# TODO:
# 1. Create two variables: name and age.
# 2. Ask the user for their name and age using input().
# 3. Print a message that says: "Hello <name>, you are <age> years old."
#
# Example:
# Enter your name: Sam
# Enter your age: 30
# Output: Hello Sam, you are 30 years old.
#
# Write your code below:
name=input("What is your name: ")
age=int(input("What is your age?: "))
print(f" Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")

# SWAP COMPUTERS
# -------------------------------------------
# 1. Save your file
# 2. Open the terminal
# 3. Run:
#    git add Ex1_review.py
#    git commit -m "Completed Task 1 - user name and age"
#    git push origin main
# 4. The next learner goes to their own computer.
# 5. On their computer, open the terminal and run:

# Task 2: Arithmetic Practice
# -------------------------------------------

# You will now use the variable 'age' from the previous task.
# You DO NOT need to create a new 'age' variable.
#
# TODO:
# 1. Create a new variable called 'next_year_age' and set it to age + 1.
# 2. Print a message like: "Next year, you will be <next_year_age> years old."
# 3. Create another variable called 'decades' which is age divided by 10.
# 4. Print: "That means you are about <decades> decades old!"
#
# Example:
# Output:
# Next year, you will be 31 years old.
# That means you are about 3.1 decades old.
#
# Write your code below:
next_year_age = age + 1
print(f"Next year, you will be {next_year_age} year old")

# Task 3: Comparison Operators
# -------------------------------------------
print("-------------------------------------------\n"
    + "Task 3: Comparison Operators\n"
    + "-------------------------------------------")
# You will now compare the user's age using if-statements.
#
# TODO:
# 1. Use if, elif, else to print:
#    - "You are a Boomer!" if age is between 61 and 79 (inclusive)
#    - "You are Gen X!" if age is between 45 and 60 (inclusive)
#    - "You are a Millenial!" if age is between 29 and 44 (inclusive)
#    - "You are not a Boomer, Millenial or Gen X" otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Output:
# You are an adult!
#
# Write your code below:
if age >= 61 and age <=79:
    print ("You are a boomer!")
elif age >= 45 and age <=60:
    print ("You are Gen X!")
